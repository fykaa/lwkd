## Developer News

Karpenter which is a Kubernetes Node Lifecycle Management Solution built for flexibility, performance, and simplicity is [joining #sig-autoscaling](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/4562) and moving to `kubernetes-sigs` GitHub org.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: RC1 released, November 28**

We are in the last countdown to the release of Kubernetes 1.29 on 5th of December; test grid looks [mostly OK](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.29-blocking). Respond rapidly to any test failures and try out running the RC in your test environment so we can catch any last-minute, showstopper usability issues. Any known issues should be added to the [Known Issues umbrella issue here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/121886) for the Release Notes team to pick them up and make sure they are a part of the final release notes.

Patch releases for all supported versions should be out this week. They will include Yet Another GoLang Update.
