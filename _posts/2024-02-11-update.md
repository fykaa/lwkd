## KEP of the Week


## KEP of the Week

[KEP-3962: Mutating Admission Policies](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/3962-mutating-admission-policies)

This KEP is introducing mutating admission policies, declared using CEL expressions, as an alternative to mutating admission webhooks. This enhancement leverages the power of CEL object construction and Server Side Apply's merge algorithms to allow in-process mutations without requiring webhooks. 
Mutations are specified within a `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` resource, referencing parameter resources for configuration. `Reinvocation` policy is extended to handle admission policies, with options for random or lexicographic ordering. Metrics and safety checks are included to ensure idempotence and deterministic final states. 
While limitations exist (e.g., no additional resource creation), this feature offers a declarative and efficient way to perform common mutations, reducing webhook complexity and improving performance.

This KEP was created in 2023, and is planned to reach it's alpha milestone in v1.30 release.
